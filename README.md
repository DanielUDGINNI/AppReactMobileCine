# Sample Snack app

The app presents an idea aimed at solving a problem identified in the past, related to people spending long periods of time in queues. It offers a simple solution by allowing customers to order snacks online, where they only need to pick up their order.
The project was developed on the Expo Go web platform, leveraging the phone simulator.

PHP was used as the backend language, with the code hosted on a web hosting service. On the other hand, the frontend was developed using the React framework. This represents an idea rather than a final product, as it would require additional modules, such as user accounts, payment handling, etc.
